Hello, my name is Jeong Seyoon.

I am 22 years old. My hometown is Ilsan and I live alone around the school. 

I entered Sungkyunkwan University in 2020. 

I went to the army and now I am in the second grade.

The languages I have are C language and Java, and I am learning various other languages such as Linux commands and Bash through open source classes this semester.
It is still the first semester of the second grade, so I lack knowledge and experience in my major, but I want to build up a lot of experience and knowledge by working hard in school life in the future.
